 
 * Good chat management: Regardless of your LLM of choice, you tend to get way better results if you keep to a kind of "develop feature X" - okay it's good? new chat window time. Otherwise you start to encounter all the weird memory/token issues with context a lot sooner, especially with complex asks.
Cannot state enough that rules and project settings are game changing.
 * Be explicit that you want it to always read in all your current to-do lists, markdown files, overall strategy, architecture, data schema, etc before doing anything. 
 * Build out each of those (with the agent if you prefer, or solo) to define what they are. i was very explicit that I wanted a folder hierarchy that was delineated by backend-frontend-debug-test-etc and what falls into each.
 * Explicitly stated: hey were using fastapi, we're using python and nodejs, etc. and that i always prefer the latest stable versions of them.
 * Explicitly stated rules for every feature to be developed to use markdown files, to capture requirements/status/when to use it, etc. Makes it way easier to pick back up / provide context in every new session especially over time.
 * Outlined what I want and expect from testing, that i dont want random data unless i prompt for it, that i dont want to it just create test files, that i always want it clean up any test files we do make, etc. Especially when iterating quickly on stuff you can produce tons of (potentially crap) stuff pretty quickly.
 * I tend to treat it like  it's an employee or at work in terms of clarifying stuff deeper and deeper and keeping everything tracked. Make a high level strategy of Ben wants to make the next whatever, Uber competitor.  Great, that starts with some rough plan for scaling, backend, front end, which mobile platform first, etc.  Then I like to keep tiered 'to-do' list at each level so i can very literally go  "What's left in frontend dev?" and have it read in the context and see that i scoped 10 big features, and that we have 5 other feature .md files tied to this fully done and implemented and 5 more in XYZ states, or 3 of them ready but not tested, or whatever.
